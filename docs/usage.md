Each of these should be prioritized for remediation based on potential exploitability and impact.

## Nessus Scan: ESXi Vulnerabilities

The following screenshot shows a Nessus scan result for an ESXi host. The scan detected multiple high-risk vulnerabilities, including:

- **CVE-2020-4004**: Use-after-free in XHCI USB controller.
- **CVE-2020-4005**: Privilege escalation in VPM process.

## Runtime Security Monitoring with Contrast Security
Overview
To assess the security of the WebGoat application at runtime, 
the Contrast Security Agent was deployed to monitor HTTP interactions, 
track user input, and flag potential vulnerabilities during execution. 
This method enables detection of real-time security risks that may not be caught by static analysis or conventional scanners.

# Setup
- The Contrast agent was integrated with the WebGoat container environment. Once deployed, it began monitoring for:
- Injection attacks
- Authentication and session issues
- Misconfigurations
- Insecure data handling

# Visual Results
- Screenshots of the Contrast Security dashboard showing these results are included:

## WordPress Web Server Scan (Nikto)
- scan task located at Ansible/Playbooks/nikto-scan.yml
- This scan checks the WordPress instance deployed on lab_03. It uses Nikto to detect outdated software, misconfigurations, and common web vulnerabilities.

- The output is stored in an HTML file and fetched to the Ansible control node at:
  wordpress/lab_03/tmp/{{ report_name }}

## Infection Monkey Network Attack Simulation Summary
- Scan Tool: Infection Monkey
- Scope: Full internal network
- Visual Output: Infection Map showing attacker behavior simulation

# Key Findings:
- 5 machines discovered on the network.
- 2 machines successfully breached.
- 40% exploitation rate, indicating notable lateral movement potential.

# Exploitation Paths:
- The monkey exploited two machines after performing scanning, then moved laterally using tunneling techniques.
- The attack paths are color-coded:
  Red: Exploitation
  Orange: Scanning
  Blue: Tunneling
  Grey: Island communication (no exploitation)
